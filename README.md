# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
Using data from the United State Geological Survey (https://www.usgs.gov/) we have created maps with overlays that include:
 - Earthquake locations
 - Tectonic plate locations
 
These ovarlays are displayed on maps created by us using MapBox API. These maps also have layers displayed as:
 - Street
 - Satellite
 - Dark

Each of these layers displays to the user as a different map type seeming to be different maps.
